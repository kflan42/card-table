Bugs:

 - [no repro] if someone reloads during a game, sometimes 1 other person ends up in an error
 - draw n doesn't work due to sending actions too fast (need multi card action)
 - loading cards got wacky for 2nd game for some players, missing cards, extra cards (race condition in server?)
 -- game banana
 --- 2 players move 2 cards from bf to graveyard, end up with 1 dupe in graveyard and 1 missing
 ---- Solterranean moved Sphinx's Revelation from their Battlefield to their Graveyard,
 ---- Kerran moved Sphinx's Revelation from Solterranean's Battlefield to Solterranean's Graveyard
 - BLOCKER - undef in looking up a battlefield card, moving cardId 494 from BF to GY but it's not in BF?

User Feature Requests:

 - [] build options form for playerPrefs (non-game)
 - -[] adjustable card size: bf & hand.
 - -[] higher quality card image option
 - -[] adjustable log width
 - [] image url for playmat (avoid hosting user images)
 - delete token on graveyard drop
 - support TCGPlayer card lists
 - [] list games on login screen?
 - timestamp in log when people taking too long (perhaps output minute or turn clock red if > last action + 60s)

My ideas:
 - prompt to confirm (or hold shift to enable) acting on other player's things
 - end turn button (output a log line for clarity)
 - post-game stats screen, show count and types of actions
 - ability to hide a player if they've left the game
 - undo as a server side operation: delete last action & force reload (join can use same force reload)

Long term:
 - move reducer game update logic to server, just send updated objects to client
 - - do random property based testing on it

Longer term:
 - planes walkers with default loyalty counter (need more SF data)
