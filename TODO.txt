Bugs:

- need to support new rolling URLs for card data https://scryfall.com/blog/category/api
 - when 3 players joined 'blue' after many actions, I lost Garruk from my BF and odd ones ended up in my GY
 - - maybe js actions / events from old game got resolved and sent with new game name?

User Feature Requests:
 - i to identify set / number
 - replay mode to review what happened? (season scoring reference)
 - [] build options form for playerPrefs (non-game)
 - -[] adjustable card size: bf & hand.
 - -[] higher quality card image option
 - -[] adjustable log width
 - [] image url for playmat (avoid hosting user images)
 - delete token on graveyard drop
 - [] list games on login screen?

My ideas:
 - remove limit on log lines, but need virtual scroll trick to avoid too many elements
 - prompt to confirm (or hold shift to enable) acting on other player's things
 - end turn button (output a log line for clarity)
 - post-game stats screen, show count and types of actions
 - undo as a server side operation: delete last action & force reload (join can use same force reload)

Long term:
 - move reducer game update logic to server, just send updated objects to client
 - - do random property based testing on it
 - - ensure all clients seeing same game, enforce ordering of action resolutions

Longer term:
 - planes walkers with default loyalty counter (need more SF data)
