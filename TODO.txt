Bugs:

 - [fixed] drag and drop sometimes ends up on a battlefield but with x or y way off screen
 - [] properly report exception when card not found (see hello_my_ports.log)
 - if someone reloads during a game, sometimes 1 other person ends up in an error

User Feature Requests:

 - [] build options form for playerPrefs (non-game)
 - -[] adjustable card size: bf & hand.
 - -[] higher quality card image option
 - -[] adjustable log width
 - [done] tighter battlefield grid
 - [] image upload for playmat
 - delete token on graveyard drop
 - [covered by D and B] draw 7 shortcut for game start (option on library? shuffle too, w/o open) mulligan
 - support TCGPlayer card lists
 - [done] 'B' shortcut card to top/bottom of library, esp from Hand
 - [] kick/leave function (hide battlefield)
 - [] list games on login screen?
 - timestamp in log when people taking too long (perhaps output minute or turn clock red if > last action + 60s)
 - [done] order players like english writing when > 2

My ideas:
 - prompt to confirm (or hold shift to enable) acting on other player's things
 - end turn button (output a log line for clarity)
 - post-game stats screen, show count and types of actions
 - ability to hide a player if they've left the game
 - undo as a server side operation: delete last action & force reload (join can use same force reload)

Long term:
 - move reducer game update logic to server, just send updated objects to client
 - - do random property based testing on it

Longer term:
 - planes walkers with default loyalty counter (need more SF data)
