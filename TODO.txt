Bugs:

 - table names monday and Monday means only former is loadable
 - auto-reload on new player join not firing
 - [fixed] keyboard actions catching instead of Library search input (but create Token input ok)
 - [fixed] player A acting on player B's things not shown in red
 - [can't repro] Ashton dragged a mountain from his hand to my battlefield and it vanished
 - - then later Niall tapping a land tapped one of Ashton's cards and vice-versa
 - - - even later Ashton creating 2 tokens led to an "undefined card" and react error handler fired

User Feature Requests:

 - [done] slightly larger cards by default
 - build options form for playerPrefs (non-game)
 - - adjustable card size: bf & hand. (need bf pos relative to card size)
 - - higher quality card image option
 - - adjustable log width
 - support Xmage deck format (Alex's decks)
 - image upload for playmat
 - delete token on graveyard drop
 - [not an issue after a few rounds] number in player boxes to see turn order more clearly
 - [not necessary] draw 7 shortcut for game start (option on library? shuffle too, w/o open)
 - [done] log line names use player colors


My ideas:
 - prompt to confirm (or hold shift to enable) acting on other player's things
 - end turn button (output a log line for clarity)
 - post-game stats screen, show count and types of actions
 - ability to hide a player if they've left the game
 - undo as a server side operation: delete last action & force reload (join can use same force reload)

Long term:
 - move reducer game update logic to server, just send updated objects to client
 - - do random property based testing on it

Longer term:
 - planes walkers with default loyalty counter (need more SF data)
