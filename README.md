# card-table
My first serious side project! A React front end and Flask back end for a multiplayer card game.

A design doc is at [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1VzVYroTFGN9OCPzqnnTsSIXlY-MaFofX), though there might be a few updates that weren't added to it.

## Features

Everything you need for a night of a table top card game with friends, assuming you already have voice or text chat solved. 

One can:

 * create rooms with _security by obscurity_.
 * create tables within the rooms, play 1 game per table.
 * load your cards based on an imported deck list.
 * chose your name and your sleeve color.
 * get an idea of who is on what table and join the table.
 * see your cards in various gameplay zones.
 * place simple counters or import other cards as needed for counters.
 * know when other players are moving cards around or peeking.
 * undo any action (if your friends let you).

## Instructions for Deployment

I run it in the Google App Engine's Free Tier for my friends - sorry I can't fit more players on the tiny backend! You'll need to host it yourself if you want to play.

I've deployed the frontend to a GCS Bucket, but doing so is not a hard requirement. 
The Flask server can handle serving the frontend assets and backend API requests, although it is currently configured to only do the latter.

To stay on top of new card releases, I setup a Cloud Scheduler triggered Cloud Function to reload the card data.

See my-server/NOTES.txt for instructions.

## Instructions for Play

I recommend getting a tutorial from someone who knows it. Within minutes you'll be talking about the game instead of the interface.

You can read these in the game interface by hovering over the ‚ùî, but here they are for an idea of what's possible.

Drag and drop cards for most things. Click on a card to tap/untap it.

Keyboard actions:
```
key	 action
a	to draw a line from your 1st click on a card/player to your 2nd click on a card/player
A	clear your lines
n	pass turn to next player
	----
D	draw a card
M	mulligan dialog
c	create a counter on a card
C	create a token card, can choose to copy if cursor is over a card
B	put card on bottom of Library
G	put card in Graveyard
E	put card in Exile
F	turn a card facedown (or up)
R	rotate a card 180 degrees (e.g. a Flip card)
T	transform or turn over a two-side card
U	untap all your tapped cards
	----
^	vote to reset the game, counters and tokens will vanish and cards not in sideboard will go to library
v	view a large popup of the card under the cursor, press again to close
V	view a large popup of the other side of the card under the cursor
H	hide a player (or show a hidden one) via a dialog
O	open the options dialog to configure stuff
```

Click on the table to focus input there then press the key.

Click on the üé≤ to simulate die rolls or coin flips.

Click on the ‚ûï to add a Player Counter such as Poison or Commander Damage.
